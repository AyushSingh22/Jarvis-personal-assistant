# J.A.R.V.I.S --- personal-assistant
The Virtual AI personal assistant 
JARVIS stands for “Just A Rather Very Intelligent System”

It is a fictional artificial intelligence that first appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe where he was voiced by Paul Bettany in Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Avengers, etc.


OBJECTIVE
To make a personal assistant by using Python like Google Alexa ,building our own Personal Assistant J.A.R.V.I.S.

Perform many other daily tasks doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, playing music with the help of a single voice command.

SPEAK FUNCTION
To make our J.A.R.V.I.S. talk, we will make a function called speak().
 We must supply audio so that we can pronounce it using the speak() function we made. For that we have to install a module called pyttsx3.
pyttsx3 : it help us to convert text to speech.
